            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">My name is Austin C. Ford, thanks for stopping by! Games of every kind have
                been my #1 passion for as
                long as I can remember and learning how to make them for the past 10 years has been so much fun. I’ve
                taken to pretty much every aspect of making games, from coding gameplay mechanics, designing stories,
                and crafting 3D assets.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">I’ve spent the past 8 years of my game development career working primarily in
                Unity, and I am most
                comfortable programming in C# (although I’m no stranger to other languages as well). I’ve worked on
                projects alone, as part of a team, and led a team of software engineering students for a period of
                several months. I’ve also worked with Unreal Engine 4 to create a few tech demos and projects to test
                Unreal’s scene creation, animation pipeline, and blueprint system.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">My other passion, closely related to games, is 3D design and modeling.
                Autodesk Maya has been my software
                of choice, and I’ve been using it for about 6 years. My style of choice is low poly but highly detailed
                objects. I have been an artist on multiple projects for both school and personal work, and create free
                3D models with Creative Commons Attribution for people to download and use.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Besides playing and making games, I love to watch movies, woodwork, bake, and
                practice my photography as
                I walk around town or hike in the woods of upstate NY. I enjoy interests and hobbies that I not only
                love by themselves, but have helped me to develop as a digital creator and problem solver.</p>
